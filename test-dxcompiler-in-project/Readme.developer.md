# test-dxcompiler-in-project Developer Readme

## Applet Requirements

Applet `test-dxcompiler-in-project` is meant to be published as an applet in a project to facilitate testing of WDL workflows in that project. It requires
- Java 8, to run `java -jar dxCompiler.jar compile <workflow>`
- `CONTRIBUTE` access to the project, to run the workflows (this should be automatic if used as an applet)
- Regional dxCompiler assets to already exist on the platform
